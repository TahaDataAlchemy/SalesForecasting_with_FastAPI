1. "forecast_quality_assessment"
2. "trend_and_seasonality_analysis"
3. "model_feature_interpretation"
4. "forecast_outlook_summary"

### üß© ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Forecast Quality Assessment
- Discuss model accuracy using metrics like MAPE, RMSE, and R¬≤.
- Interpret the reliability and bias of residuals.
- Mention how many historical points were used and how that affects confidence.
- Give a numerical trust score (0‚Äì100%).
- Example:
  "The forecasting model achieved a MAPE of 3.37%, indicating excellent predictive accuracy across 39 months of sales data."

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Trend and Seasonality Analysis
- Identify which **months or quarters** historically showed strong or weak performance.
- Quantify overall growth or decline trends.
- Detect seasonal peaks (e.g., ‚ÄúSales usually rise sharply in July and December‚Äù).
- Note any anomalies or volatility spikes.
- Predict which upcoming months or quarters may perform best.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Feature Interpretation
- Describe the top features influencing the forecast (e.g., quarter, month, dayofweek).
- Explain how each feature contributes to variance in the model.
- Connect features to real-world behavior (‚ÄúQuarterly sales cycles drive 29% of model variance‚Äù).
- Suggest simple data experiments (like A/B tests) based on features.
- Avoid repeating generic language ‚Äî make it data-aware.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Forecast Outlook Summary
- Describe the **expected sales direction and magnitude** in the forecast period.
- Quantify uncertainty (e.g., RMSE, CI width, or residual std).
- Highlight risk periods or opportunity windows by month or quarter.
- Use clear numeric values and contextual predictions (‚ÄúNext quarter expected growth: +12%‚Äù).
- Provide short-term and medium-term outlooks.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing and Business Recommendations
- Give actionable, data-driven advice (marketing, operations, inventory, pricing).
- Reference **specific months, quarters, or metrics** when possible.
- Recommend tactical adjustments (inventory %, pricing, campaigns).
- Mention monitoring KPIs (e.g., ‚ÄúTrack weekly deviation vs forecast ¬±10%‚Äù).
- Suggest a quick-win experiment or short-term optimization.

    "The forecasting model achieved a MAPE of 3.37%, indicating high predictive accuracy across 39 data points.",
    "RMSE of 5.83 reflects minimal deviation, confirming that the model generalizes well over multiple months of sales data.",
    "R¬≤ of 0.9991 suggests that nearly all variance in historical sales is captured by the model, with no significant overfitting signs.",
    "Residual distribution remains balanced, indicating unbiased forecasting performance across time.",
    "Overall, this model provides a 92% confidence level for near-term planning."
  ],
  "trend_and_seasonality_analysis": [
    "Sales historically peaked in March and November, showing strong quarterly seasonality in Q1 and Q4.",
    "Growth trends over the past 12 months indicate a steady 42.5% increase in overall sales volume.",
    "Volatility levels remain moderate at around 23%, with small dips observed during summer months such as July and August.",
